# What is Markdown?

### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Gists
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension


## GitHub Flavored Markdown

### GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.
