Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

### Target Audience: individuals
What is the age range o ●● f your target audience?
●● Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
●● Which country do your visitors live in?
●● Do they live in urban or rural areas?
●● What is the average income of visitors?
●● What level of education do they have?
●● What is their marital or family status?
●● What is their occupation?
●● How many hours do they work per week?
●● How often do they use the web?
●● What kind of device do they use to access the web

## Why People Visit
## YOUR Website

### Key Motivations
●● Are they looking for general
entertainment or do they
need to achieve a specific
goal?
●● If there is a specific goal, is
it a personal or professional
one?
●● Do they see spending time on
this activity as essential or a
luxury?
Sp ecific Goals
●● Do they want general
information / research (such
as background on a topic /
company), or are they after
something specific (such as a
particular fact or information
on a product)?
●● Are they already familiar with
the service or product that
you offer or do they need to
be introduced to it?
●● Are they looking for time
sensitive information, such as
the latest news or updates on
a particular topic?
●● Do they want to discover
information about a specific
product or service to help
them decide whether to buy
it or not?
●● Do they need to contact you?
If so, can they visit in person
(which might require opening
hours and a map)? Or might
they need email or telephone
contact details?
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.

## Site Maps

Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.



The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.
To help you decide what
information should go on each
page, you can use a technique
called card sorting.
This involves placing each
piece of information that a
visitor might need to know on
a separate piece of paper and
then organizing the related
information into groups.
Each group relates to a page and,
on larger sites the, pages can in
turn can be grouped together to
create different sections of the
website.
The groups of information are
then turned into the diagram
that is known as the site map.
Sometimes it can be helpful to
ask people who are the target
audience to help you group
related information together.
A site map will usually
begin with the homepage.
Additionally, if the site is large
and is compartmentalized
into sections, each section
might require its own section
homepage to link to all of the
information within it.
For example, most online shops
have section homepages for
each type of product, which then
in turn link to individual product
pages.
You may need to duplicate some
information if it needs to appear
on more than one page.
The pages (or groups of pages)
will inform how users navigate
through the site.
Remember to focus on the
goals that your visitors want to
achieve.
It is worth noting that the
site owner might organize
information in a way that is
different to what the public
expects. It is important to reflect
the public's understanding of the
subject (rather than just the site
owner's understanding of it).
Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.
